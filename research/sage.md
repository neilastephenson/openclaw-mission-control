## Overview

Private personal agent, recently open-sourced.

## Key Features (from tweet excerpt)

> "Over the past month, I've been building my own private personal agent called Sage. With openclaw blowing up recently, thought it was a good time to open source it and get a little demo going."

Highlights:
- **Private LLMs/embeddings via Maple AI** — no data sent to OpenAI/Anthropic
- **E2EE messaging** — end-to-end encrypted

## Relevance

Interesting for privacy-focused architecture. If we ever need to move away from cloud services (Supermemory) to fully local/private, Sage + Maple AI could be a reference architecture.

## Status

Could not access full thread/repo (X blocking fetches). Need to follow up when X access is restored.
